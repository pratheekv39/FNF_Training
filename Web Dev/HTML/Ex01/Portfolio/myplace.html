        I grew up in <strong>Hassan</strong>, a beautiful city located in the heart of Karnataka. 
        Known for its rich history, serene landscapes, and architectural marvels, Hassan holds a special place in my heart. 
        It is a gateway to some of the most iconic temples and heritage sites in South India, including the famous Chennakeshava Temple in Belur.
